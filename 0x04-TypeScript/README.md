## Usage

To run the TypeScript files, you will need to install `typescript` and `ts-node` modules.

To install `typescript` and `ts-node` modules, run the following commands:

```
npm install -g typescript
npm install -g ts-node
```

Once these modules are installed, you can run the files using the `ts-node` command.
